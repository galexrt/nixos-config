# nixos-config

The NixOS config of a NixOS newbie ;-)

The config here can probably be improved a lot by someone that knows more about NixOS, though as it stands the config works fine for me and helps me reduce time spent on configs/OS issues.

## `machines/` directory

Contains per machine config.

## Styling

Custom styles that need to be manually applied.
